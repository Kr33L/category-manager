// Your mini-app should take user input for

//     A category name
//     A category icon
//     A category colour

// When the user clicks ‘Next’, it should display the recently added category name, icon and colour, with a ‘Back’ button (not designed).
// When the user clicks ‘Back’, the newly created category should now be added to the list and displayed.
// When the user chooses a previously made category and clicks ‘next’, it should display the previously set category name, icon and colour.
// The user is also able to delete the category by hovering over the category and pressing the ‘delete’ (rubbish bin) icon.
// The user is able to edit the category by hovering over the category and pressing the ‘edit’ (pencil) icon.
// Uses localStorage to store the categories.
// You will be scored on how easy the code is to follow, understand, and maintain. Please give thought to folder structure and any additional unseen elements of your code.
